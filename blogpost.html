                    I find that in times of stress and confusion, the 
                    best thing to do is to make you'reself feel better by
                    judging lesser beings as lesser than you'reself. Forget
                    the endless dissapointement you bring you're family and
                    the lack of initiative your taking in your career.
                    You can at least say you don't look as dumb as you're.
